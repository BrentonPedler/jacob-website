                        A lifelong mover, sports-enthusiast and exercise-practitioner, I transitioned from a career in
                        the
                        plant-based culinary industry to one in health and fitness in 2016. Since then, I’ve taught
                        thousands of
                        group-classes and one-on-one training sessions all over the city, and am planning to teach a few
                        thousand more! I have taught, and continue to teach a broad range of modalities, from
                        traditional
                        vinyasa-yoga to strength training. My multi-disciplinary approach allows me to cater to a broad
                        base
                        of
                        people, be they experienced or compete beginners, and my unique fusion of strength training,
                        traditional
                        yoga breath-work and postural practices, and functional mobility coaching caters to an expansive
                        demographic.

                        As a trainer, my primary points of focus are functionality and happiness. First and foremost, I
                        want
                        to
                        make sure that those training with me feel comfortable, safe and secure in their bodies, whilst
                        also
                        possessing the prerequisite strength and mobility to perform their day-to-day tasks and
                        activities
                        with minimized risk of injury and discomfort. Beyond this, I tailor my training programmes to my
                        students
                        needs. Some train for sport-performance, others for aesthetic, and others for health and
                        longevity.
                        Moreover, many of my students have a multitude of needs and desires, and I am here for all of
                        them!
                        I
                        aim to make my training environment safe and comfortable regardless of student experience, and
                        do my
                        very best to create a body-positive, encouraging and judgement-free space to train in.

                    maintaining a safe and fun environment. His encouragement is infectious, our rapport is great, and I
                    feel so much better about my body and myself after just a few short months. Highly recommend to
                    anyone searching for an affordable, reliable, and thoughtful instructor.”
